# This is my emacs setup

I use Evil mode for vim emulation. Honestly, I think it does Vim better than Vim. Flycheck for C++ syntax checking, smartparens for structured editing, and key-chord for some bindings. 
I completely avoid using the Meta key in all of my bindings, for 2 reasons: I find it horribly uncomfortable to use,
and its in different places on different keyboards. All of my bindings are Ctrl- or Leader- based (my leader is comma)

If this sounds like your kind of setup, feel free to copy it.
